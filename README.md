# Semantic Analysis of Genes Associated with Muscular Dystonia

## Project Overview

This bioinformatics project demonstrates the application of **Semantic Web technologies** (RDF, OWL, SPARQL) to model, integrate, and query structured knowledge about **genes implicated in muscular dystonia**. The project focuses on the construction of a **FAIR-compliant knowledge graph** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) that links genomic entities (genes, mutations, proteins) with clinical phenotypes (dystonia syndromes). This approach enables complex biomedical queries and supports integrative data analysis across heterogeneous biological resources.

For detailed methodology, complete results, and implementation, see:

## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates the use of **Semantic Web technologies in biomedical research**.
- Shows how structured knowledge graphs can integrate genomic and clinical data.
- Highlights FAIR data principles and interoperability with public resources.
- Serves as a practical example of **ontology-driven bioinformatics analysis**.
